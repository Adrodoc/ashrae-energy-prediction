Faulty Readings:

I ll give a short example of how we find "faulty" meter readings
in this plot we can see the mean meter reading by_building
and pretty obvious there is building with extreme high values going up to 20 mio kwh

we further inspect this building which is number 1099 and can see for meter 2
that this meter is producing these outliers
The plot shows the mean meter readings per hour in blu and per day in orange
So as we can see this meter has values up to 20 000 mio kwh per hour
And we defined a cutoff value for this meter at about 30 000 kwh and dropped all rows
that contained higher values, and helped to improve our score

1 minute 

Some showed that for example dropping zeros in site 0 (first 140 days are zero or nearly zero)
helps most (17,8 percent)

Other indicators:
Unjustified runs of zero readings: We identify sequences of more than 48 hours with zero readings 
which do not occur during the typical seasons for the designated meter type
Zero readings for electical meters: There's no reason for a building to ever have zero electrical usage,
so we simply throw them all away.
The first 141 days of electricity for site 0: Most of these would be covered by the previous sets, 
but there are a few stray non-zero values that we ignore because they don't fit the overall pattern.
Abnormally high readings from building 1099: These values are just absurdly high and 
don't fit an established pattern. Leaderboard probes show that we do indeed benefit by dropping the outliers.


Timestamp Alignment:

Ok so timestamps turned out to be a pit tricky and heres why:
Before we can merge our training data with the weather data
we observe following as we see in this plot:
For site 4 and site 5 we have plotted the relative mean air temperature and electricity
now what's interesting here:
For site 4 the meter reading has its peak in for BOTH sites around midday/ afternoon
so for meter reading theres not much difference for different sites
BUT the temperature for site 4 peaks around midnight and for site 5 it peaks around 3 pm
And that leads to the conclusion that the meter reading timestamps are measured in local time
and weather timestamps are given in utc world time.
So what do we do?
Some people on kaggle did the work to find out where the different sites might be located by
playing internet detective and searching for the buildings or correlate wheather data for different cities
And with that information we can find the differences between the respective timezone of meter reading
and the world time for weather
and as we can see here after timestamp alignment the peaks look much more reasonable.
